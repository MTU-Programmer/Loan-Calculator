# Loan-Calculator

![Alt text](loan_calculator.jpg?raw=true "Loan Calculator")
This is a flexible loan Amortization calculator.

It can solve many kinds of loan calculation problems.
1. It can tell you how long it will take to repay a loan, known as Terms or repayment periods.
2. It can accept APR or EFF interest rates. If you want to use EFF for the per centage rate, then zero the APR field first.
It featurs monthly and yearly repayment schedule tables.

In the Amortization table, Balance Outstanding refers to the amount of the original loan
that is still unpaid.

The Deferred Payment area shows the total amount to be repaid including the interest on the loan.
It also shows the total interest amount as money and as a per centage of the total to be repaid.

The Loan Calculator features 6 different SolveFor scenarios.

Written in Microsoft Visual C# 2019 Community Edition. The complete source code is included.
